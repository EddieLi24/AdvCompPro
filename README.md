### WordGame
A basic game of hangman that allows the user to input letters, determine if the letter is correct, and calculate the amount of tries left

Pseudocode: 
Start
Generate a word at random and store it in a variable
Display the length of the word to the user
Initialize variable LIVES = 6
while loop runs while LIVES > 0
Prompt user to guess a letter a through z
if Condition 1: check if letters match don’t match
if true, variable LIVES decrease by 1
elif: letter match
if true, replace the blank with said letter
if condition 2: check if word is equal to random word
if true: print “Congratulation you win!” and end loop
if condition 3: check whether LIVES = 0
if true: print “You lose” and end loop
End while loop
